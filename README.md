Hi Everyone!

Today we're going to create a new web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).

In this tutorial, a JavaScript Beginner can create a functional Weather App with ease. and won't face any problems doing that.

You must know the basics in JavaScript and HTML, like JavaScript Objects, functions, If statements, ... etc

The only difficulty you might face, is how to work with an API using JavaScript? but trust me that won't be of a big problem.
First things first, you'll need to sign up to get an API key from http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org. It's like your secret ticket to accessing their weather data. Once you have that key, you're good to go.


Time to dive into the nitty-gritty of your project! Picture this: Our weather app is about to take center stage, and here's what it's bringing to the table. Get ready for an exciting display of weather data fetched straight from the API. We're talking a slick weather status icon, the current temperature (a comfy 18°C, in Celsius, of course), a brief weather description (let's say, "clear sky"), topped off with the user's location – city and country, which in this case is London, GB. This app is going to make weather updates a breeze! 🌦️🌍📊

Now, here's a cool feature: If the user decides to click on the temperature value, we'll work our coding magic and convert it from trusty Celsius to Fahrenheit. It's like giving your app a little temperature makeover!

Oh, and speaking of style, the icons that will give our web application that extra flair are the brainchild of the talented Graphic Designer, Ashley Jager. You can find her incredible work right here on her GitHub Repo: https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons.

For the data wizardry behind the scenes, we've got the API provider http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org in our corner, delivering real-time weather info to make our app shine.
